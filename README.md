# FactorioWorld

A mod for factorio that changes the map into a real-world map.

Note that it only changes the terrain, and not the spawning of trees and resources.

## Installation

1. Create folder named "factorio-world_0.1.0" in your mods folder
1. Download this repo
1. Put everything from this repo into that folder

Note: The folders "Screenshots" and "MapGenerator" aren't strictly needed to install the mod, but they don't harm either.

## Usage

Simply start a new game, you should then start in England.

## Limitations

* Currently only grass, water and dirt is generated
    * The mod is written to support everything, however the image-converter only supports those 3 for the moment.
* You always start in England
* The map should be infinite, many many times the same world next to eachother. However this is untested.
    * Actually, there hasn't been much testing yet, so there could be many bugs.
